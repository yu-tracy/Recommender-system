Recommender System
===================================================

## About the project
This project implemented three types of recommender systems: collaborative filtering, content-based and hybrid recommender systems. To evaluate how good these recommender systems are, I userd the Rank Based Utility Measures and the Error Based Measure.

About the datasets, I worked with the "Software" category of the Amazon Review Data (2018), and used the "5-core" subset and the "complete review data" dataset. (See https://nijianmo.github.io/amazon/index.html)
